# Work Scheduler

#### This work scheduler allows users to write what they need to do at various hours throughout the 9am to 5pm work day. It uses moment.js to display the current hour in red, past hours in grey and future hours in green. The user's text input is stored in local storage if save is pressed. Text input persists even if the page is refreshed.
